📌 Currency Converter Web App

A simple and responsive Currency Converter web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another in real time using a live exchange-rate API.

The application provides an easy-to-use interface with country flags, dropdown currency selection, and automatic rate updates. It fetches the latest exchange rates dynamically and displays accurate conversion results instantly.

This project helped me understand API integration, DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous JavaScript (async/await).
